# EV Charging Points Analysis

This project focuses on the analysis of Electric Vehicle (EV) charging points data. The notebook provides a comprehensive overview of the data extraction, cleaning, preparation, transformation, and analysis processes.

## Data Extraction and Loading Process

The data extraction and loading process involves the following steps:
1. **Importing Libraries**: Necessary libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn are imported.
2. **Loading the Data**: The dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame using the `pd.read_csv` method.
3. **Previewing the Data**: The first few rows of the dataset are displayed using `df.head()` to understand the structure and content of the data.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation Techniques

The data cleaning and preparation techniques include:
1. **Handling Missing Values**: Missing values in the dataset are identified and handled appropriately. Common methods include filling missing values with mean/median or dropping rows/columns with missing values.
2. **Data Type Conversion**: Ensuring that each column has the appropriate data type for analysis. For instance, converting date columns to datetime format and categorical columns to category type.
3. **Removing Duplicates**: Checking for and removing duplicate rows to ensure data integrity.
4. **Outlier Detection and Treatment**: Identifying and handling outliers using statistical methods to prevent skewed analysis results.

## Data Transformations and Analysis

Data transformations and analysis are performed to extract meaningful insights:
1. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features that can provide additional insights. For instance, extracting the hour, day, or month from a datetime column.
2. **Data Aggregation**: Grouping data by relevant categories to summarize and aggregate information. This could involve calculating the average usage of charging points per location or time period.
3. **Visualization**: Creating visualizations to understand the distribution and relationships within the data. Common visualizations include histograms, bar charts, scatter plots, and heatmaps.
4. **Statistical Analysis**: Conducting statistical tests and building models to identify significant patterns and trends in the data.

## Conclusion

The notebook provides a thorough analysis of EV charging points data, from extraction and cleaning to transformation and analysis. The insights gained from this analysis can inform decisions related to EV infrastructure planning and optimization.
